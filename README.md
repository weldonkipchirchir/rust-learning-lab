# Rust Programming Concepts Showcase

This project serves as a demonstration of various Rust programming concepts and features through code examples. Each module within the project focuses on a specific aspect of Rust programming, providing explanations and sample code.

## Modules Overview

1. **Structs**: Demonstrates the usage of structs in Rust, including struct initialization, modification, and associated methods.

2. **Tuple Structs**: Shows how to define and utilize tuple structs in Rust.

3. **References**: Explains the concept of references and mutable references in Rust, along with examples illustrating their usage.

4. **Ownership**: Discusses Rust's ownership system, covering ownership transfer, moves, and borrowing.

5. **Slices**: Demonstrates string slices and array slices in Rust, along with functions that operate on them.

6. **Methods**: Illustrates the implementation of methods for structs and associated functions in Rust.

7. **Control Flow**: Covers various control flow constructs in Rust, including if-else, loops, and match statements.

8. **Enumerations**: Introduces Rust enums and showcases their usage in pattern matching and associated functions.

## Usage

To run the code examples:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
